ðŸ§® Linear Regression Health Costs Predictor

A machine learning project for freeCodeCampâ€™s Machine Learning with Python certification.
This notebook uses TensorFlow and Keras to build and train a regression model that predicts healthcare costs based on demographic and lifestyle data.

ðŸ“˜ Overview

In this challenge, the goal is to:

Predict individual healthcare expenses (expenses) using linear regression.

Use a dataset containing age, sex, BMI, children, smoker, and region.

Preprocess categorical features, split data into training/testing sets, and train a model.

Achieve a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) below $3500 on the test dataset.
